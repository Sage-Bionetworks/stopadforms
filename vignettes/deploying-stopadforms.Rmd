This vignette is applicable to Sage employees who are deploying the application
on our Shiny Pro server. To learn about the server and how to get credentials,
please read the
[Confluence documentation](https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/wiki/spaces/SageShinyServer/pages/75497489/Shiny+Server).

The app is deployed on the server through the following steps:

1. ssh into the Shiny Pro server and navigate to `/home/kwoo/ShinyApps/stopadforms`
1. `git pull` changes from GitHub
1. To ensure packages are up-to-date, open an R session and run `renv::restore()`

You may need to run `touch restart.txt` afterward to ensure the application is
restarted.
